<h1>General Rules</h1>

<h2 class="tos1">Please make sure my art style is what you want before you commission me.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">I cannot do realistic art, or super fine detailed perlers and stuff like that, so make sure you want my specific style before you try contacting me.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Artwork has to be paid for before it is made.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">I should have the money before I make the art or Kandi, so I can get materials if needed.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">How is payment taken?</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">Payment is taken through Cash-App, Venmo, and maybe even Robux at the moment, I currently cannot take anything else.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Producing art may take more than a day or two.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">This all depends on whether its digital or physical, it also depends on shipping and how long it takes me to draw everything. Please be patient.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">I cannot get out a commission in a very short amount of time, and do not offer ways to get it out that fast. Please understand.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">Shipping and in person things may get in the way, I would prefer if you reach out to me at least two or three weeks before the deadline.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Picture references are preferred, text descriptions must be detailed.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">If I don't have a picture reference for a character or bead colors you want, it makes it difficult to make the artwork since I don't know exactly what you want.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Fees could be added with extra components.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">Things like extra characters, extra special beads, props or backgrounds could add an extra fee to the artwork.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Credit should be with the art if posted.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">My name should at least be mentioned once with merch or art that is posted on social media, and possibly linked to here or one of my socials.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">I really like to stream my art!</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">If you don't want me to stream the commission, whether on twitch or to my friends, let me know beforehand! Plus, if you want to be there while I'm streaming, I'll do my best to let you know when I do!</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">You cannot profit off of any of the art I make.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">Kandi trades are an exception, but art work is not.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">I Will not work with customers who do AI Art or NFT.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">I will not take AI Art or NFTs as references for art, picrews are an exception.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Refunds</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">As of right now, refunds are unavailable as soon as work has been started. Please make sure you want my art before paying.</h3>

<h2 class="tos1">Prices are Final.</h2>

<h3 class="tos2">You may not change or negotiate price after an agreed payment.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1>This TOS may be updated as I see fit.
<br>I have the right to cancel and refund the customer, no matter what the reason.
<br>I have the right to refuse any commission or customer.
