    <h1>Beaded Kandi and such</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Kandi is such an interesting thing to make. You can make bracelets, bags, you could even make clothes if you really wanted to!
    <br>I can make most of the above, but I do have a limited supply of beads and string, which seem to be real expensive.</h2>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Once again, please be aware that there can be extra fees included with your order, 
    like if I'm out of certain beads and need to buy new ones, 
    or if you want extra fancy beads like the random assortment that I give out for free,
    or even if you want a charm added on someplace.
    <br>And also, please be patient as I cannot handle shipping myself and it may take more than a week or two, I'm not sure.</h3>
